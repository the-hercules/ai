## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-20
**There are Breaking Changes in this release.**

### Breaking Changes
- Refactor `Experiments` to be a type of `Feature`, improving how functionality is organized and surfaced ([#316](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/316)).

The following classes have been removed. Anyone that was directly using these will need to make updates to utilize the correct replacements: `Abstract_Experiment`, `Invalid_Experiment_Metadata_Exception`, `Invalid_Experiment_Exception`, `Experiment_Loader`, `Experiment_Registry`.

- Standardize the Title Generation Ability to align with other registered Abilities ([#227](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/227)).

The `ai/title-generation` Ability now uses a `context` argument instead of a `post_id` argument in the `input_schema`. Anyone directly using this Ability will need to make updates to account for that.

### Added
- New Experiment: Image Editing via prompt-based image refining in the Post Editor and Media Library ([#292](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/292)).
- New Experiment: Image Editing via expanding or removing background and removing or replacing items in the Media Libary ([#305](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/305), [#312](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/312)).

- Rename hook prefixes in `helpers.php` ([#315](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/315)).
- Rename plugin constants to `WPAI_*` ([#317](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/317)).
- Refactor the upgrade routine and add v0.6.0 migrations ([#321](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/321)).
- Move the Generate Alt Text button to the new Content tab for improved discoverability ([#306](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/306)).
- Remove stray "AI" references from UI for improved consistency ([#320](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/320)).
- Update documentation ([#314](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/314)).
