# Vendored: PHP AI Client (forward-ported SDK subset)

This directory contains a **minimal, verbatim copy** of selected classes from
[WordPress/php-ai-client](https://github.com/WordPress/php-ai-client), so the AI plugin can use
newer SDK capabilities before every environment bundles them (e.g. embedding generation lands in
WordPress core in 7.2 via
[wordpress-develop#12530](https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/12530)).

The overlay is organized into **independent features** (see `SDK_Overlay::FEATURES`). Each feature
is gated separately: an environment may already provide one feature (so the overlay defers to it)
while lacking another (so the overlay supplies it). Features are never gated on one another —
embeddings and, later, streaming activate or defer on their own.

- **Upstream:** [WordPress/php-ai-client](https://github.com/WordPress/php-ai-client)
- **License:** GPL-2.0-or-later.

## Features

### `embeddings`

- **Vendored commit:** `20a1a6d33a11d3f2955e9c5b7389af7ff51209bc` (upstream `trunk` merge commit of [PR #274](https://github.com/WordPress/php-ai-client/pull/274), which builds on [PR #244](https://github.com/WordPress/php-ai-client/pull/244))
- **Sentinel:** `WordPress\AiClient\Builders\EmbeddingBuilder` (present only if the environment already ships embeddings)

The new classes introduced by PR #244 and PR #274, plus the existing classes those PRs modified
that lie on the embedding execution path:

| Vendored file | Kind |
| --- | --- |
| `src/Builders/EmbeddingBuilder.php` | new |
| `src/Builders/Traits/ModelConfigurationTrait.php` | new |
| `src/Providers/ModelResolver.php` | new |
| `src/Providers/Models/DTO/ModelRequirements.php` | modified (adds `fromEmbeddingData()` and `getUnmetRequirements()`) |
| `src/Providers/Models/DTO/ModelConfig.php` | modified (adds `dimensions` support) |
| `src/Providers/Models/EmbeddingGeneration/Contracts/EmbeddingGenerationModelInterface.php` | new |
| `src/Results/DTO/Embedding.php` | new |
| `src/Results/DTO/EmbeddingResult.php` | new |
| `src/Events/BeforeGenerateEmbeddingEvent.php` | new |
| `src/Events/AfterGenerateEmbeddingEvent.php` | new |

**Pinned to a merged commit.** PR #274 merged upstream on 2026-08-31; these files are vendored
from the resulting `trunk` merge commit. Re-check this table against
upstream whenever a later PR touches the embedding execution path.

## What was intentionally NOT copied

- `src/AiClient.php` — its PR #244 and PR #274 changes are only static convenience wrappers; we
  build `EmbeddingBuilder` directly and use the environment's unmodified
  `AiClient::defaultRegistry()`. Vendoring it is also not an option: it is the overlay's
  base-SDK precondition class.
- `src/Builders/Traits/ModelResolutionTrait.php` — vendored for PR #244, dropped for PR #274; see
  above.
- `src/Builders/PromptBuilder.php` — refactored by PR #244, but the embedding path does not use it.
- `src/Providers/Models/Enums/OptionEnum.php` — the PR #244 diff is docblock-only; behavior is
  driven dynamically off `ModelConfig`'s `KEY_*` constants.

## Modifications applied

**One prefixed import.** WordPress core scopes the PHP AI Client's PSR dependencies under
`WordPress\AiClientDependencies\`, so the unprefixed names do not exist under a WordPress
bootstrap. `src/Builders/EmbeddingBuilder.php` imports
`Psr\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface`, and the vendored copy uses core's prefixed name.
Only the `use` line differs from upstream; the class body is byte-identical.

| File | Upstream import | Vendored import |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/Builders/EmbeddingBuilder.php` | `Psr\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface` | `WordPress\AiClientDependencies\Psr\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface` |

This is a vendoring adaptation, not an upstream bug: upstream installs its PSR packages through
Composer, where the bare name is correct. It is not a change to send upstream.

`SDK_OverlayTest::test_vendored_files_use_the_prefixed_psr_dependencies()` asserts that no vendored
file imports an unprefixed `Nyholm\…` or `Psr\…` symbol, so a future re-vendor cannot silently
reintroduce one. It matches every `Psr\` namespace rather than `Psr\Http\` alone, because core
prefixes `Psr\EventDispatcher\` and `Psr\SimpleCache\` the same way.

Otherwise unchanged. Unlike the `Secrets` vendor directory, these files keep their real
`WordPress\AiClient\…` namespace unchanged. That is required: the updated OpenAI/Google/Ollama
provider plugins must implement *this* `EmbeddingGenerationModelInterface` symbol, so it has to be
the canonical class, not a re-namespaced copy.

## How it loads

`includes/SDK_Overlay.php` decides per feature whether to `defer`, `skip`, or `activate`, and
serves **only the classes of the features that activated** from a single prepended autoloader.
Every other `WordPress\AiClient\…` class falls through to the environment's own autoloader. A
shared base-SDK precondition (`WordPress\AiClient\AiClient` must be present) gates the whole
overlay, since the vendored classes extend base-SDK classes we do not ship. See that file for the
detection, conflict-guard, and fall-through logic.

The overlay lives outside this directory on purpose: it is first-party code, and everything under
`includes/Vendor/` is exempt from PHPCS and PHPStan.

**Detection is lazy.** The autoloader registers at bootstrap, but which features activate is not
decided until the first `WordPress\AiClient\…` class is actually autoloaded, so a request that
never touches the SDK pays nothing. Probing at bootstrap would force-load the environment's own
copy of each sentinel class on every request. While probing, the overlay autoloader makes itself
inert so a probe is answered by the environment, never by our own copy.

## Adding a feature (e.g. streaming)

1. Vendor the feature's new/modified files into `src/` at their real namespace paths.
2. Add an entry to `SDK_Overlay::FEATURES` with:
   - a `sentinel` — a **net-new** class the feature introduces (never a shared/base class),
   - `guards` — any existing class the feature modifies mapped to a method only our copy defines,
   - `classes` — the exact list of fully-qualified class names the feature overlays.
3. Add the feature's vendored commit + file table to this README.

**Disjoint sets, single snapshot.** Features should own disjoint class sets. If two features must
modify the *same* class, vendor one file containing the union of both features' additions and list
it under both features' `classes`; because the whole overlay is pinned to a single, internally
consistent snapshot, a class is never needed in two incompatible versions at once. Pin to the SDK
version the target environments bundle to avoid drift with the environment's unchanged classes.

These files are exempt from PHPCS/PHPStan (`phpcs.xml.dist` excludes `includes/Vendor/`;
`phpstan.neon.dist` excludes `includes/Vendor/AiClient/src/` from scanning). The loader itself,
`includes/SDK_Overlay.php`, is first-party code and is fully linted and analysed.
