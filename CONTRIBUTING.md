# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the AI plugin! Here you'll find information on how to get started contributing to the plugin.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Composer
- Node.js 24.18+ and npm 11.16+ (for asset building)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WordPress/ai.git
cd ai
```

2. **Install dependencies and build assets:**

Before running `npm i`, ensure your Node.js and npm versions match the minimum requirements specified in the `package.json` file.

If you use `nvm` for managing Node.js versions, run `nvm use` before `npm i` to automatically switch to the correct version.

```bash
# If using nvm, run: nvm use
composer install && npm i && npm run build
```

3. **Activate the plugin:**

Through WordPress admin or via WP-CLI:

```bash
wp plugin activate ai
```

### Quality checks

Before submitting a pull request, run the following commands:

```bash
# Check coding standards
composer lint && npm run typecheck && npm run lint:js

# Run static analysis
composer phpstan

# Auto-fix coding standards issues
composer format && npm run lint:js:fix && npm run format

# Run tests
npm run wp-env:test start -- --xdebug=coverage && npm run test:e2e && npm run test:php && npm run wp-env:test stop
```

### Coding standards

All code must follow the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/). This ensures consistency across the WordPress ecosystem and makes the codebase maintainable.

### PHP Compatibility

All code must be backward compatible with PHP 7.4, which is the minimum required PHP version for this project.

### WordPress Compatibility

The plugin requires WordPress 7.0 or higher. Ensure all WordPress functions and hooks used are available in this version.

### Documentation standards

All code must be properly documented with PHPDoc blocks following these standards:
All parameters, return values, and properties should use explicit type hints where possible, following WordPress best practices for PHP 7.4+ compatibility.

### Naming conventions

The following naming conventions must be followed for consistency and autoloading:

- Contracts live under `includes/Contracts/` and use descriptive names (e.g., `Feature`).
- Traits, when introduced, should use descriptive names and follow the existing PSR-4 layout.
- File names are the same as the class, trait, and interface name for PSR-4 autoloading.
- Classes use WordPress naming conventions with underscores where useful for readability (e.g., `Settings_Registration`).
- Namespaces follow the pattern `WordPress\AI\{Component}`.

### General rules

- All descriptions must end with a period.
- Use `@since x.x.x` for new code (version will be updated on release).
- Place `@since` tags below the description and above `@param` tags, with blank comment lines around it.

### Method documentation

- Method descriptions must start with a third-person verb (e.g., "Creates", "Returns", "Checks").
- Exceptions: Constructors and magic methods may use different phrasing.
- All `@return` annotations must include a description.

### Interface implementations

- Use `{@inheritDoc}` instead of duplicating descriptions when implementing interface methods.
- Only provide a unique description if it adds value beyond the interface documentation.

### Example

```php
/**
 * Class for handling feature registration.
 *
 * @since x.x.x
 */
class Registry {
	/**
	 * Registers a new feature with the plugin.
	 *
	 * @since x.x.x
	 *
	 * @param Feature $feature The feature instance to register.
	 * @return bool True if registered successfully, false otherwise.
	 */
	public function register_feature( Feature $feature ): bool {
		// Implementation
	}
}
```

### Array Lists

When an array is a list — that is, an array where the keys are sequential, starting at 0 — use the `list` generic type within the docblock. For example, a parameter that is a list of strings would be documented as `@param list<string> $variable`.

Note that `list<string>` and `string[]` _are not_ the same. The latter is an alias for `array<int, string>` which does not enforce that the keys are sequential.

### Internationalization

All user-facing strings must be translatable using WordPress i18n functions:

```php
// Good
__( 'Hello World', 'ai' );
_e( 'Hello World', 'ai' );
esc_html__( 'Hello World', 'ai' );

// Bad
echo 'Hello World';
```
