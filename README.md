> AI features and experiments for WordPress. Modular framework for testing AI capabilities.

## Description

The AI plugin provides a set of opt-in AI features for authors, editors, and admins directly within WordPress. It serves as a reference implementation for developers, agencies, and hosts looking to build or extend AI-powered workflows using building blocks from the WordPress AI team (as [*part of the **AI Building Blocks for WordPress** initiative*](https://make.wordpress.org/ai/2025/07/17/ai-building-blocks)).

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin is experimental.  Features may change, move, or break.  Use on Production sites at your own risk.  It is recommended to test in a non-Production environment and follow the plugin’s development closely if adopting early.

## Overview

* **Purpose:** Demonstrate and deliver AI features by combining the AI Building Blocks ([PHP AI Client SDK](https://github.com/WordPress/php-ai-client), [Abilities API](https://github.com/WordPress/abilities-api)) into a unified WordPress experience.
* **Scope:** Reference implementations, user-facing AI features, and experimental capabilities for testing and feedback.
* **Audience:** WordPress users, content creators, site administrators, and developers learning the AI APIs.

This [Canonical Plugin](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/11/canonical-plugins-revisited/) is built following the [Features as Plugins model](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/features-as-plugins/). The community will help evaluate which features could evolve toward inclusion in WordPress core based on testing, feedback, and adoption.

### Editor Support

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The AI plugin is built exclusively for the Block Editor (aka Gutenberg).

The AI plugin does not currently support the Classic Editor plugin or other non-Block Editor editing experiences.

This is an intentional project decision.  The Block Editor has been the default WordPress editing experience since WordPress 5.0, released in December 2018, and continues to be the primary editor actively developed by the WordPress project.  Focusing on a single editing experience allows contributors to move faster, explore new AI-powered workflows, and build deeper integrations without the overhead of maintaining multiple editor implementations.

While the Classic Editor plugin remains widely used, the AI plugin is focused on the future direction of WordPress editing and content creation.  Contributors interested in bringing AI functionality to the Classic Editor are welcome to explore and maintain those integrations, but support for Classic Editor is not currently planned by the plugin's maintainers.

## Design Goals

1. **Showcase integration** – Demonstrate how all Building Blocks work together (e.g., connects to providers via PHP AI Client integration).
2. **User-focused** – Deliver practical AI features users can use today, integrated seamlessly into Gutenberg (block & site editors) and WordPress admin flows. Minimal setup required prioritizes user control, with manual review defaults before automation.
3. **Experimentation lab** – Test new AI capabilities and gather feedback.
4. **Path to core** – Explore which features should become part of WordPress.

## Current Features

* **[Abilities Explorer](docs/experiments/abilities-explorer.md)** – Discover, inspect, test, and document all abilities registered via the WordPress Abilities API.
* **[AI Request Logging](docs/experiments/ai-request-logging.md)** – Logs AI requests for observability and debugging.
* **[Alt Text Generation](docs/experiments/alt-text-generation.md)** - Generates descriptive alt text for images using AI vision models.
* **[Comment Moderation](docs/experiments/comment-moderation.md)** - Automatically moderate comments based on toxicity detection and sentiment analysis.
* **[Connector Approvals](docs/experiments/connector-approval.md)** - Require explicit administrator approval before plugins or themes can use AI connectors configured on this site.
* **[Content Classification](docs/experiments/content-classification.md)** – Suggests relevant tags and categories to organize content.
* **[Content Resizing](docs/experiments/content-resizing.md)** - Shorten, expand, or rephrase selected block content.
* **[Content Summarization](docs/experiments/summarization.md)** - Summarizes long-form content into digestible overviews.
* **[Content Translation](docs/experiments/content-translation.md)** - Translates paragraph and heading blocks, and optionally the post title, into a selected language from the post editor.
* **[Custom Abilities](docs/experiments/custom-abilities.md)** - Gates the plugin's general-purpose WordPress Abilities behind a single opt-in toggle.
* **Dashboard Widgets** - AI Status and AI Capabilities widgets, plus framework for registering new ones.
* **[Editorial Notes](docs/experiments/editorial-notes.md)** - Reviews post content block-by-block and adds Notes with suggestions for Accessibility, Readability, Grammar, and SEO.

* **[Personas](docs/experiments/personas.md)** - Define reusable personas (role, audience, and brand voice) and apply one across content generation experiments, site-wide or per post.
* **[Slug Generation](docs/experiments/slug-generation.md)** - Suggests SEO-friendly permalink slugs from post title or content, in the permalink popover and the pre-publish panel.
* **[Suggest Reply](docs/experiments/suggest-reply.md)** - Adds a "Suggest Reply" action to the Comments screen and Activity widget, enabling moderators to quickly generate comment reply suggestions.
* **[Title Generation](docs/experiments/title-generation.md)** -  Generates title suggestions from content.
* **[Type Ahead](docs/experiments/type-ahead.md)** – Contextual type-ahead assistance for suggestions while typing.

## Provider Setup

The AI plugin does not include provider credentials or provider implementations by itself. To use AI-powered features, install and activate at least one AI Connector plugin, then configure its credentials in `Settings -> Connectors`. Features may appear unavailable until a connector is installed, authenticated, and capable of the required operation.

Provider connector plugins include [Anthropic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ai-provider-for-anthropic), [Google](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ai-provider-for-google), [OpenAI](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ai-provider-for-openai), and [others](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/connector/).

## Roadmap

You can view the active plugin roadmap in a filtered view in the WordPress AI [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/240/views/1).

Overview of planned features:

* **AI Playground** – Experiment with different AI models and providers.
* **Content Assistant** – AI-powered writing and editing in Gutenberg.
* **Site Agent** – Natural language WordPress administration.
* **Workflow Automation** – AI-driven task automation.

## Developer Experience

The AI plugin is meant to be studied, forked, and extended.  If you’re a host or agency, you can install and configure AI Connector plugins on behalf of your users so they don’t need to bring their own API keys.

If you’re a plugin developer, you’ll be able to:

* Read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed development information.
* Read the [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) to learn how to contribute to the plugin or create your own AI-powered experiments.
* Study the [Custom Experiment Reference](docs/experiments/custom-experiment-reference.md) for an end-to-end extension example.
* Register new AI abilities.
* Override default behavior with custom filters.
* Reuse the same building blocks in your own plugins.
