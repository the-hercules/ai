# Feature and Experiment Lifecycle

The AI plugin supports two categories of opt-in functionality: **Features** and **Experiments**.  This document describes how each is defined, how Experiments are proposed and developed, how functionality can be promoted from Experiment to Feature, and how a specific Experiment/Feature may eventually graduate toward WordPress core.

This is a descriptive guide, not a rigid policy.  The goal is to help contributors understand how things typically work, set reasonable expectations, and reduce uncertainty when proposing or building new functionality.

The process intentionally favors learning and iteration over certainty.

## Features and Experiments

Both Features and Experiments are opt-in and must be individually enabled.

**Features** are stable and ready for general use.  They are expected to evolve without breaking existing behavior where possible, and are supported over time with bug fixes and incremental improvements.

**Experiments** are early-stage and actively being developed.  They are subject to breaking changes or removal without notice and are used to validate ideas, workflows, and integrations before broader adoption.

### How They Appear in the UI

On the AI settings screen:

- **Features** are presented prominently with richer UI and visual emphasis
- **Experiments** are listed below as simpler controls (e.g., checkboxes)

All functionality is registered with a declared stability type (`stable`, `experimental`, or `deprecated`) which controls how it is surfaced in the UI and communicates stability expectations to contributors and users.

### Promoting an Experiment to a Feature

An Experiment may be promoted to a Feature when it demonstrates:

- **Stability** — No significant breaking changes are expected in normal usage.
- **Clear user value** — Solves a meaningful problem or improves a core workflow.
- **UX maturity** — Interaction model is understandable, consistent, and integrated.
- **Technical reliability** — Errors are handled gracefully and performance is acceptable.
- **Maintainability** — Contributors are confident supporting it long-term.

When promoting, update the stability type from `experimental` to `stable`, move the code from the `Experiments` directory to the `Features` directory, move the settings into the Features section of the AI settings UI, remove experimental labeling, review for backward compatibility or data migrations, and update documentation and release notes accordingly.

Promotion is expected to be one-way.  Reclassifying a Feature back to an Experiment should be rare and avoided.

#### Proposing an Experiment to a Feature

A single GitHub issue to propose moving an Experiment to a Feature should be utilized for discussion with [AI team leads](https://make.wordpress.org/updates/team-reps/) and [AI plugin maintainers](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/blob/develop/CREDITS.md#maintainers) including reference in an AI Contributor call and summary post so others are aware and can comment.  Final decision rests with the team leads and plugin maintainers based on criteria referenced in this doc.

## How Experiments are Evaluated for the Plugin

Each Experiment is evaluated independently.  Inclusion in the AI plugin does not imply endorsement for core, nor a guarantee of long-term support.

In practice, most Experiments follow a four-step path.

### 1. Proposal via GitHub Issue

New Experiments generally start with a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/issues) that outlines the idea and intent.  This issue acts as the shared point of alignment before any meaningful implementation work begins.

A good proposal usually includes:

* The problem being explored and the user value it aims to test
* A short description of the proposed behavior or workflow
* Clear scope boundaries (what is in and out of scope)
* Low-fidelity mockups, diagrams, or written flows where applicable
* Known risks, unknowns, or open questions

At this stage, rough clarity is more important than completeness.  The goal is to decide whether the idea is worth experimenting on at all. [Here's an example of a particularly detailed proposal issue](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/issues/10).

An additionally encouraged, though not required, step would be to open a PR that explores how the proposed feature could be implemented and function.  Here's an example of an [exploratory PR](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/pull/156) from its [proposal issue](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/issues/44); using a Draft PR state and the [`[Type] Proof of Concept` label](https://github.com/WordPress/ai/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22%5BType%5D%20Proof%20of%20Concept%22) will help separate these sorts of PRs from more actively planned and milestoned work.

### 2. Assessment of Proposed Experiment

Once a proposal has been opened, the [AI plugin maintainers](../CREDITS.md#maintainers) will work to assess viability and rationale for including the proposed experiment within the plugin as opposed to within a separate plugin, within Gutenberg or WordPress core directly, or perhaps generally "not likely a fit for the AI plugin" for described reasons.

For proposals that are aligned to the AI plugin purpose and roadmap, they'll be added to the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/projects/240/views/7) and assigned a numbered milestone (or `Future Release` for those unlikely to be ready in the near future but still warranted within the plugin).

### 3. Implementation via Pull Request

Once there is general agreement on direction, a pull request can be opened to implement the Experiment.

Expectations for Experiments at this stage:

* Code is intentionally scoped and easy to remove or revise
* The Experiment is isolated from unrelated functionality
* Feature flags or Experiment toggles are used where appropriate
* Failure modes are considered and handled safely
* Minimal documentation is added to explain how the Experiment works (examples in `docs/experiments`)

Experiments are expected to evolve.  Early implementations do not need to be production-ready, but they should be reviewable, testable, and understandable by others.

### 4. Review, Testing, and Inclusion

Final approval for inclusion in the plugin is handled by the [plugin maintainers](../CREDITS.md#maintainers).

When reviewing an Experiment, maintainers typically consider:

* Alignment with the goals of the AI plugin
* Code quality and long-term maintainability
* User experience and clarity
* Safety, performance, and data handling considerations
* Whether the Experiment is sufficiently self-contained

Once approved, the Experiment ships as part of the plugin and is explicitly treated as experimental.  It may change significantly or be removed entirely based on learnings.

## How an Experiment Graduates Toward WordPress Core

Graduation is optional and uncommon.  Most Experiments are expected to inform future work rather than ship directly to core.

When graduation does happen, it applies to a specific Experiment, not the AI plugin as a whole.

### 1. Evidence of Value and Stability

Before any merge discussion, an Experiment typically demonstrates:

* Clear user value informed by testing or feedback
* Stability across multiple plugin releases
* Iteration based on real-world usage
* A well-defined and defensible scope

At this point, the Experiment should feel predictable and boring in the best sense.

### 2. Broader Testing via Gutenberg (When Appropriate)

For editor-facing Experiments, the most common next step is migration into the Gutenberg plugin.

This allows:

* Significantly broader testing than the AI plugin alone
* Use of established Gutenberg Experiment and feedback workflows
* Closer alignment with editor UX patterns and architecture

Not every Experiment requires this step, but it is the preferred path before proposing a core merge.

### 3. Proposal to WordPress Core

A proposal to merge into WordPress core should focus on a single Experiment/Feature and follow the [Feature Plugin Merge Criteria](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/release-cycle/features-as-plugins/#feature-plugin-merge-criteria) used by core.

The proposal typically documents:

* The exact feature being proposed
* Why it belongs in core
* How it aligns with WordPress project goals
* What validation and testing has been performed, and what evidence demonstrates user value
* AI-specific considerations such as data handling, model behavior, bias, privacy, and failure modes
* Remaining risks or open questions
* A clear ownership and maintenance plan

For AI-driven features in particular, proposals are expected to go beyond traditional unit tests and documentation. They should clearly articulate:

* How the feature was evaluated (qualitative feedback, usage data, structured testing, etc.)
* What guardrails are in place to prevent misuse or harmful outputs
* Why the behavior represents a net positive for users and aligns with WordPress best practices rather than hype

Acceptance into core is ultimately a core leadership decision and may require further iteration or restructuring.

## Important Notes

* Features are expected to be stable and supported, breaking changes should be avoided
* Experiments may be deprecated or removed at any time
* Experiments may undergo breaking changes. Unless absolutely not feasible, those will occur in a Major version bump of the AI plugin to help signify those changes
* Not all Experiments are intended to graduate to core, in fact most are never expected to and instead are expected to stay within the plugin
* Learning and validation are considered successful outcomes

The AI plugin exists to make it safe to explore ideas early, learn quickly, and improve the quality of features that may eventually reach WordPress core.
