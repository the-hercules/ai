# Developer Guide

Welcome to the AI plugin development guide. This document provides everything you need to know to contribute to the plugin or create your own AI-powered experiments.

## Creating a New Experiment

Experiments are the core building blocks of the AI plugin. Each experiment represents a distinct piece of functionality that may utilize AI capabilities.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Encapsulation**: Each experiment is self-contained and can be reviewed independently
2. **Modularity**: Experiments can be added/removed without affecting core functionality
3. **Extensibility**: Third-party developers can register custom experiments via hooks
4. **Standards Compliance**: All code follows WordPress coding standards

### Step 1: Create Experiment Directory

Create a new directory in `includes/Experiments/` for your experiment:

```bash
mkdir -p includes/Experiments/My_Experiment
```

### Step 2: Create Experiment Class

Create your experiment class by extending `Abstract_Feature`:

```php
<?php
/**
 * My Experiment implementation.
 *
 * @package WordPress\AI\Experiments
 */

namespace WordPress\AI\Experiments\My_Experiment;

use WordPress\AI\Abstracts\Abstract_Feature;
use WordPress\AI\Asset_Loader;

/**
 * My Experiment class.
 *
 * @since 0.1.0
 */
class My_Experiment extends Abstract_Feature {
  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  public static function get_id(): string {
    return 'my-experiment';
  }

  /**
   * {@inheritDoc}
   */
  protected function load_metadata(): array {
    return array(
      'label'       => __( 'My Experiment', 'ai' ),
      'description' => __( 'Description of what my experiment does.', 'ai' ),
    );
  }

  /**
   * Registers the experiment's hooks and functionality.
   *
   * @since 0.1.0
   */
  public function register(): void {
    // Register your hooks here
    add_action( 'init', array( $this, 'initialize' ) );
    add_action( 'admin_enqueue_scripts', array( $this, 'enqueue_assets' ) );
    add_filter( 'the_content', array( $this, 'filter_content' ) );
  }

  /**
   * Initializes the experiment.
   *
   * @since 0.1.0
   */
  public function initialize(): void {
    // Experiment initialization logic
  }

  /**
   * Enqueues and localizes the admin script.
   *
   * @since 0.1.0
   *
   * @param string $hook_suffix The current admin page hook suffix.
   */
  public function enqueue_assets( string $hook_suffix ): void {
    Asset_Loader::enqueue_script( 'my-experiment', 'experiments/my-experiment' );
    Asset_Loader::localize_script(
      'my-experiment',
      'MyExperimentData',
      array(
        'enabled' => $this->is_enabled(),
      )
    );
  }

  /**
   * Filters content.
   *
   * @since 0.1.0
   *
   * @param string $content Post content.
   * @return string Modified content.
   */
  public function filter_content( string $content ): string {
    // Experiment logic here
    return $content;
  }
}
```

If you want a complete end-to-end reference instead of a starter snippet, see the [Custom Experiment Reference](experiments/custom-experiment-reference.md). It points to the in-repo `Example_Experiment` implementation and shows a minimal third-party plugin example using the same extension points.

### Step 3: Register the Experiment

Register your experiment class via the `wpai_default_feature_classes` filter. The built-in experiments are registered through the `Experiments` class, but third-party experiments can be added the same way:

```php
add_filter( 'wpai_default_feature_classes', function( $classes ) {
  $classes[ My_Experiment::get_id() ] = My_Experiment::class;
  return $classes;
} );
```

### Step 4: Add Experiment Documentation

Create a `README.md` in your experiment directory:

```markdown
# My Experiment

Brief description of the experiment.

## Functionality

- What the experiment does
- How it works
- Any requirements

## Usage

Examples of how to use the experiment.

## Configuration

Any settings or filters available.
```

### Conditional Experiments

If your experiment has requirements (PHP extensions, other plugins, etc.), check them before attaching runtime hooks. `Abstract_Feature` owns a final constructor, so experiment classes should not implement their own constructor for validation:

```php
class My_Experiment extends Abstract_Feature {
	public function register(): void {
		if ( ! extension_loaded( 'gd' ) ) {
			// Optionally add an admin notice here.
			return;
		}

		add_action( 'init', array( $this, 'initialize' ) );
	}
}
```

## Plugin API

The plugin provides a set of hooks and filters to allow third-party developers to extend its functionality.

### Registering a Custom Experiment

Developers can register their own experiments using the `wpai_register_features` action. This is the primary way to add new functionality to the plugin.

```php
add_action( 'wpai_register_features', function( $registry ) {
	$registry->register_feature( new My_Custom_Experiment() );
} );
```

### Filtering Default Experiments

Modify the list of default experiment classes before they are instantiated:

```php
add_filter( 'wpai_default_feature_classes', function( $feature_classes ) {
  // Add a custom experiment
  $feature_classes[ My_Custom_Experiment::get_id() ] = My_Custom_Experiment::class;

  // Remove a default experiment
  unset( $feature_classes['title-generation'] );

  return $feature_classes;
} );
```

### Disabling an Experiment

Experiments can be disabled using the `wpai_feature_{$feature_id}_enabled` filter:

```php
// Disable a specific experiment by its ID
add_filter( 'wpai_feature_title-generation_enabled', '__return_false' );

// Or with a custom callback
add_filter( 'wpai_feature_title-generation_enabled', function( $enabled ) {
  // Your custom logic here
  return false;
} );
```

### Disabling All Experiments

Disable all experiments at once with the code-level `wpai_features_enabled` filter:

```php
add_filter( 'wpai_features_enabled', '__return_false' );
```

### Preserving Data on Uninstall

Deleting the plugin removes all of its data: the `wpai_request_logs` and `wpai_embeddings` tables, every `wpai_*` option (including any encrypted connector API keys), the plugin's transients, its user meta, and its scheduled events. Deactivating the plugin changes nothing — cleanup only runs on deletion.

To keep that data, return `false` from the `wpai_remove_data_on_uninstall` filter from a plugin or must-use plugin that is still active when the AI plugin is deleted:

```php
add_filter( 'wpai_remove_data_on_uninstall', '__return_false' );
```

On multisite the filter runs once per site, so `get_current_blog_id()` can be used to preserve data for some sites while cleaning others:

```php
add_filter( 'wpai_remove_data_on_uninstall', function( $remove_data ) {
  return 1 !== get_current_blog_id();
} );
```

### Other Hooks

The plugin also includes the following action hooks:

- `wpai_register_features`: Fires after default features are registered, receives `$registry` parameter
- `wpai_features_initialized`: Fires after all enabled features have run `register()`. It does not fire if the loader-level `wpai_features_enabled` filter returns false.

### Editorial Guidelines

When the `wp_knowledge` post type is available, AI abilities can opt into site-wide editorial guidance for tone, copy, image, and other prompt constraints. Each guideline lives in its own published `wp_knowledge` row (for example `guideline-site` or `guideline-copy`) with the text in the post content. The plugin consumes those guidelines; it does not manage the guidelines UI.

Abilities opt in by returning the categories they support:

```php
protected function guideline_categories(): array {
  return array( 'site', 'copy' );
}
```

Supported categories are `site`, `copy`, `images`, and `additional`. Block-specific guidelines can also be included when a block name is supplied to the prompt formatter.

For code that generates prompts outside an ability, use the helper functions:

```php
$xml = WordPress\AI\format_guidelines_for_prompt(
  array( 'site', 'copy' ),
  'core/paragraph'
);

$guidelines = WordPress\AI\get_guidelines();
```

The `wpai_use_guidelines` filter can disable guideline injection, and `wpai_max_guideline_length` controls the per-category character limit.

### Asset Loading

The plugin provides a utility class for loading assets. This uses `wp-scripts` to build assets which are expected to live within the `src/` directory. They will then be built into the `build-scripts/` directory, where the asset loader will look for the files, pulling in the proper dependencies and versioning.

```php
use WordPress\AI\Asset_Loader;

/**
 * Enqueue a script.
 *
 * First argument is the script handle.
 * The second argument is the script file name.
 * The optional third argument is a boolean to include the core abilities script.
 * This script file name should be in the build-scripts/ directory.
 * The source script files should be in the src/ directory. If needed,
 * you can add the entry point to the webpack.config.js file.
 */
Asset_Loader::enqueue_script( 'my-experiment', 'experiments/my-experiment' );

/**
 * Enqueue a style.
 *
 * First argument is the style handle.
 * The second argument is the style file name.
 * This style file name should be in the build-scripts/ directory.
 * The source style files should be in the src/ directory. If needed,
 * you can add the entry point to the webpack.config.js file.
 */
Asset_Loader::enqueue_style( 'my-experiment', 'experiments/my-experiment' );

/**
 * Localize a script.
 *
 * First argument is the script handle.
 * The second argument is the data object name.
 * The third argument is the data to localize.
 * In this example, the data will be available in the script as `aiMyExperimentData`.
 */
Asset_Loader::localize_script(
  'my-experiment',
  'MyExperimentData',
  array(
    'my_data' => 'my data',
  )
);
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature-name
```

### 2. Implement Your Experiment

Follow the steps in [Creating a New Experiment](#creating-a-new-experiment) above to build your experiment.

### 3. Write Tests

Add or update tests for your code in the existing test suite under `tests/Integration/`:

```php
<?php
namespace WordPress\AI\Tests\Integration\Experiments\My_Experiment;

use WordPress\AI\Experiments\My_Experiment\My_Experiment;
use WP_UnitTestCase;

class My_Experiment_Test extends WP_UnitTestCase {
  public function test_experiment_metadata() {
    $this->assertEquals( 'my-experiment', My_Experiment::get_id() );

    $experiment = new My_Experiment();
    $this->assertNotEmpty( $experiment->get_label() );
  }
}
```

## Merge Strategy

### Squash Merging

This project makes use of squash merges from PR branches to the `develop` branch and as such we've disabled the "Allow merge commits" and "Allow rebase merging" in the repo so that anyone merging will be forced into the "Allow squash merging" approach.

An example of a squash merge from #359 can be seen in 4c9699f, while an example of the prior approach of a merge commit from #311 can be seen in e63d8c0.

### Squash Merge Commit Title and Description

As you squash merge a PR, where reasonable please update the title of the squash merge commit to be a good top-level summary of the change (removing extraneous `[WIP]`, `Fixes Issue ###`, and other non-helpful text).  The ideal format here would be like "New Experiment: Comment Moderation" so that reviewing the commit history on `develop` can quickly comprehend the changes happening.

Remove any commit messages from the PR that end up in the commit description, replacing them with the Changelog entry(ies) in the PR description.  If there's no Changelog entry in the PR description, then please do your best to generate that changelog entry from your perspective in what's happening in the PR.

With this approach, when we get into the [release process](RELEASE_INSTRUCTIONS.md) we can much more quickly build a release changelog by leveraging the squash merge commit titles.

A minute of your time when merging a PR to appropriately set the squash merge commit title and description will save many others even more time when reviewing changes in `develop` and when building a release.  Thanks for helping others save time!

### Merging PRs

All members of the [ai-maintainers team](https://github.com/orgs/WordPress/teams/ai-maintainers) within the WordPress org on GitHub have the ability to review and merge PRs.  If you are not a maintainer but have reviewed a PR and are confident in the code, approve the PR and comment pinging @wordpress/ai-maintainers or a specific maintainer who has been involved in the PR.  Once a maintainer confirms there are no objections, you are free to merge the PR into `develop`.

Most PRs will be automatically assigned a release milestone, but please make sure your merged PR was assigned one.  Doing so creates the historical legacy of what code landed when, and makes it possible for all project contributors (even non-technical ones) to access this information.

### Joining the ai-maintainers team

If you have 2-3 meaningful accepted contributions, ask in the [#core-ai Slack channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C08TJ8BPULS) to get added to a specific section of the CODEOWNERS file so you're auto-assigned for PR reviews.

If you have 3-5 meaningful PR reviews after being added to CODEOWNERS, ask in the [#core-ai Slack channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C08TJ8BPULS) to get added to the ai-maintainers team.

### Closing PRs

Sometimes, a PR may not be mergeable, no matter how much additional effort is applied to it (e.g. out of scope).  In these cases, it’s best to communicate with the contributor graciously while describing why the PR was closed, this encourages productive future involvement.

Make sure to:

1. Thank the contributor for their time and effort.
2. Fully explain the reasoning behind the decision to close the PR.
3. Link to as much supporting documentation as possible.

If you’d like a template to follow:

> Thanks \_\_\_\_ for the time you’ve spent on this PR.
>
> I’m closing this PR because \_\_\_\_. To clarify further, \_\_\_\_.
>
> For more details, please see \_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_.
