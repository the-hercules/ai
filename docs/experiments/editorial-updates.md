# Editorial Updates

## Summary

The Editorial Updates experiment enables users to automatically apply pending editorial feedback/notes to their WordPress post content using AI. Clicking "Editorial Updates" in the post sidebar triggers the AI to contextually examine all blocks with pending Notes and modify the text according to the provided suggestions.

## Overview

### For End Users

When enabled, an "Editorial Updates" button appears in the post status info panel (the sidebar area below the post status) assuming there is at least one Note pending on any block in the post. Clicking it triggers the refinement process:

1. The button label updates to show progression across blocks (`Refining block (2 of 4)…`)
2. Each block that has a pending Note attached is sent to the AI alongside the Note's content.
3. The AI precisely updates the block content resolving the note feedback.
4. The post is saved, creating a revision checkpoint.
5. After completion, a success snackbar with a "Review in Revisions" action lets the user review the diff safely and rollback if necessary.

**Key Features:**

- Precise block-level content refinement guided strictly by user/editorial feedback comments.
- Asynchronous batched block processing for improved performance and reliability.
- Robust state rollback using native WordPress Revisions viewer so users can diff the changes smoothly.

### For Developers

## Architecture & Implementation

### Block Types Supported

Can safely run against any block. Output targets formatting of standard block markup (e.g. inner wrappers).

### Input Schema

```php
array(
    'block_type'     => array(
        'type'        => 'string',
        'description' => 'The block type, e.g. core/paragraph, core/heading.',
    ),
    'block_content'  => array(
        'type'        => 'string',
        'description' => 'The content of the block to refine.',
    ),
    'notes' => array(
        'type'        => 'array',
        'items'       => array( 'type' => 'string' ),
        'description' => 'The feedback Notes to apply to the block.',
    ),
    'context'        => array(
        'type'        => 'string',
        'description' => 'Optional surrounding content for context.',
    ),
    'post_id'        => array(
        'type'        => 'integer',
        'description' => 'ID of the post being modified.',
    ),
)
```

### Output Schema

```php
array(
    'type'        => 'string',
    'description' => 'The updated block content after applying feedback.',
)
```

### Permissions

The ability's `permission_callback` operates via two paths:

- **With a numeric `post_id` (post ID):** Validates that the post exists, the current user has `edit_post` capability for that specific post, and the post type is registered with `show_in_rest => true`. Returns `false` if the post type is not REST-accessible.
- **Without a post ID:** Requires `current_user_can( 'edit_posts' )`.

In both cases, users without the required capability receive an `insufficient_capabilities` WP_Error.

## Using the Ability via REST API

### Endpoint

```text
POST /wp-json/wp-abilities/v1/abilities/ai/editorial-updates/run
```

### Authentication

See [TESTING_REST_API.md](../TESTING_REST_API.md) for authentication details (application passwords or cookie + nonce).

### Request Examples

#### Refine a Paragraph Block

```bash
curl -X POST "https://yoursite.com/wp-json/wp-abilities/v1/abilities/ai/editorial-updates/run" \
  -u "username:application-password" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": {
      "block_type": "core/paragraph",
      "block_content": "We shuld try an fix up this stuff.",
      "notes": ["Fix typos and grammar."],
      "post_id": 42
    }
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
"We should try and fix up this stuff."
```
