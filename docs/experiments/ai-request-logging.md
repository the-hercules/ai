# AI Request Logging

## Summary
Provides an opt-in observability surface that records every AI request (provider, model, duration, token counts, status, and request source) and exposes them through a React-powered dashboard under `Tools → AI Request Logs`. When enabled, the SDK's HTTP transporter is wrapped with a logging decorator using the public `setHttpTransporter()` API.

## Key Hooks & Entry Points
- `WordPress\AI\Experiments\AI_Request_Logging\AI_Request_Logging::register()`:
  - Calls `AI_Request_Log_Manager::init()` to ensure the log table schema is synchronized and the cleanup cron exists.
  - Calls `Logging_Integration::init()` so the SDK transporter is wrapped only while the feature is enabled.
  - `rest_api_init` → registers `WordPress\AI\Logging\REST\AI_Request_Log_Controller`, which exposes `/ai/v1/logs`, `/summary`, `/filters`, and per-log endpoints.
  - `admin_menu` → registers `WordPress\AI\Logging\AI_Request_Log_Page`, which adds the `Tools` submenu and enqueues assets.
- Database + cleanup are handled inside `AI_Request_Log_Manager::init()` (schema-version-gated table sync, cron scheduling, option storage).

## Architecture
The logging system uses the decorator pattern to wrap the SDK's HTTP transporter:

1. `Logging_Integration::init()` is called from the feature registration flow when the experiment is enabled.
2. On `wp_loaded` or `admin_init`, `Logging_Integration::wrap_transporter()`:
   - Gets the current transporter from `AiClient::defaultRegistry()`
   - Creates a `Logging_Http_Transporter` decorator around it
   - Uses `registry->setHttpTransporter()` to swap in the logging version
3. All subsequent AI requests go through the logging transporter, which records metrics before delegating to the underlying transporter.
4. `Logging_Http_Transporter` also inspects the PHP call stack to record whether the request was initiated by a plugin, mu-plugin, theme, or WordPress core file when that can be determined.
5. Data extraction is handled by `Log_Data_Extractor`, which parses request/response payloads and extracts provider, model, tokens, and previews.

This approach uses the SDK's public API rather than reflection or internal hacks, making it resilient to SDK updates.

## Public API
Consumers that surface abilities themselves — an MCP server, or code invoking an ability directly — can record their own requests instead of shipping a parallel log.

### `WordPress\AI\log_ai_request()`
Writes an entry to the same log the experiment populates. Returns the log identifier on success, or `false` when the experiment is disabled or the write failed, so it is safe to call unconditionally.

```php
\WordPress\AI\log_ai_request( array(
    'type'        => 'mcp_tool',       // Required. One of AI_Request_Log_Manager::get_types().
    'operation'   => 'example/tool',   // Required. Non-empty string.
    'status'      => 'success',        // Required. Non-empty string.
    'provider'    => 'openai',
    'model'       => 'gpt-5-nano',
    'duration_ms' => 120,
    'context'     => array( 'input_preview' => '…' ),
) );
```

`type`, `operation`, and `status` are validated: anything else triggers `_doing_it_wrong()` and no row is written. `type` must be one of the values `AI_Request_Log_Manager::get_types()` returns — `ai_client` (generations made through the AI Client SDK), `mcp_tool`, or `ability`. A row carrying an unlisted type could never be filtered through the REST API, and `operation` and `status` are stored in columns that cannot be null.

The REST `type` filter enum is derived from `get_types()`, so the read and write sides cannot drift apart.

## Action Hooks

### `wpai_request_logged`
Fires after an entry is written, with the log identifier and the stored row. Lets consumers react to logged requests without polling the REST endpoint.

```php
add_action( 'wpai_request_logged', function( $log_id, $data ) {
    if ( 'error' === $data['status'] ) {
        // Alert on failed AI requests.
    }
}, 10, 2 );
```

## Filter Hooks
The logging system exposes several filter hooks for extensibility:

### `wpai_request_log_providers`
Filters the provider detection patterns. The default map is derived from the connectors registry — every `ai_provider` connector contributes a host-substring pattern equal to its slug (with `google` matching `googleapis` since its API runs on a different domain). This filter is the extension point for non-connector providers or for connectors whose slug doesn't appear in their API host (for example, a connector whose API is served from an unrelated domain).

```php
add_filter( 'wpai_request_log_providers', function( $patterns ) {
    $patterns['my_provider'] = array( 'my-api.com', 'api.myprovider.io' );
    return $patterns;
} );
```

### `wpai_request_log_context`
Filters the log context data before it's stored. Allows adding custom context or removing sensitive data.

```php
add_filter( 'wpai_request_log_context', function( $context, $decoded, $log_data ) {
    $context['custom_field'] = 'custom_value';
    unset( $context['sensitive_field'] );
    return $context;
}, 10, 3 );
```

### `wpai_request_log_tokens`
Filters the extracted token usage. Allows custom providers to supply their own token extraction logic.

```php
add_filter( 'wpai_request_log_tokens', function( $tokens, $response ) {
    if ( isset( $response['my_token_field'] ) ) {
        $tokens['input'] = $response['my_token_field']['in'];
        $tokens['output'] = $response['my_token_field']['out'];
    }
    return $tokens;
}, 10, 2 );
```

### `wpai_request_log_kind`
Filters the detected request kind (text, image, embeddings, audio, metadata).

```php
add_filter( 'wpai_request_log_kind', function( $kind, $provider, $path, $payload ) {
    if ( false !== strpos( $path, '/my-custom-endpoint' ) ) {
        return 'custom';
    }
    return $kind;
}, 10, 4 );
```

### `wpai_request_log_retention_days`
Filters the time-based retention period in days. Logs are retained indefinitely by default (the filter returns `0`). Return a positive integer to delete entries older than that many days during the daily cleanup.

```php
add_filter( 'wpai_request_log_retention_days', function() {
    return 30;
} );
```

## Assets & Data Flow
1. When `AI Request Logs` is visited, `Asset_Loader` enqueues `admin/ai-request-logs` (`src/admin/ai-request-logs/index.tsx`) plus its stylesheet. The localized payload (`window.AiRequestLogsSettings`) includes REST routes, a nonce, and initial state (summary and filter metadata).
2. The React app:
   - Configures `@wordpress/api-fetch` with the nonce/root.
   - Fetches logs (`GET /ai/v1/logs` with search/filter params) and displays them in a table with pagination.
   - Uses a persisted operations multi-select that excludes `*:models` discovery calls by default so capability lookups do not drown out actual request traffic unless the user opts in.
   - Fetches summaries (`GET /ai/v1/logs/summary`) for the KPI cards, including `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, and `all` periods, and filter metadata (`GET /ai/v1/logs/filters`).
   - Sends `DELETE /ai/v1/logs` to purge the table.
3. On the backend, every AI HTTP request flows through `Logging_Http_Transporter`, which records metrics via `AI_Request_Log_Manager::log()` before returning the response to callers. Logs are stored in the `wp_ai_request_logs` table alongside JSON-encoded context for later inspection.

## Testing
1. Toggle **AI Request Logging** on, and ensure valid AI credentials exist.
2. Trigger an AI-powered feature (e.g., Type Ahead or Title Generation) so the system issues at least one completion request.
3. Navigate to `Tools → AI Request Logs`. Confirm the chart and table populate, and that `*:models` discovery calls only appear after you explicitly include them in the operations filter.
4. Click "Purge logs", confirm the success notice, and check the table empties.
5. Disable the experiment and reload a front-end AI feature; no new rows should appear, and the logging integration should remain inactive.

## Notes
- Logs are retained indefinitely by default. Add a `wpai_request_log_retention_days` filter returning a positive integer if you want time-based cleanup.
- REST endpoints require `manage_options`.
